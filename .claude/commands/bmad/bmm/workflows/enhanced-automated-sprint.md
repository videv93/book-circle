# Enhanced Automated Sprint Pipeline

> **TL;DR for humans:** This skill automates the entire dev lifecycle for multiple stories in an epic. You give it an epic ID (and optionally specific story IDs), and it runs each story through: **create → refine → validate → write tests → implement → code review → adversarial review → fix issues → verify → update sprint status**. Stories can run in parallel when independent. You approve the plan upfront and get prompted at key decision points (story review, fix prioritization, failures). Everything else is hands-off.

> **Usage:** `/enhanced-automated-sprint 7` or `/enhanced-automated-sprint 7 7-1 7-2 --parallel 2`

Run the full BMAD pipeline for **multiple stories** in an epic using task-based tracking and focused agents.

## Configuration

This skill uses BMAD config variables from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`:

| Variable                   | Source      | Used For                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `{output_folder}`          | config.yaml | Story files, sprint status, planning artifacts |
| `{user_name}`              | config.yaml | Agent greetings and communication              |
| `{communication_language}` | config.yaml | Agent output language                          |
| `{project-root}`           | runtime     | All file path resolution                       |

### Project-Specific Verification Commands

The pipeline runs verification checks at multiple steps. Configure these for your project's tech stack:

```yaml
# CUSTOMIZE THESE for your project:
test_command: 'npx jest' # or: pytest, go test ./..., cargo test
test_list_command: 'npx jest --listTests | wc -l' # for test count regression check
typecheck_command: 'npx tsc --noEmit' # or: mypy, go vet, skip if not applicable
build_command: 'npm run build' # or: cargo build, go build, make
lint_command: 'npm run lint' # optional, add to verification if present
```

The coordinator reads these from the project's `CLAUDE.md` or `package.json` scripts. If not found, fall back to the defaults above.

## Input Format

```
$ARGUMENTS = <EPIC_ID> [STORY_IDS...] [--parallel N] [--skip-elicitation] [--auto-fix]
```

**Examples:**

- `/enhanced-automated-sprint 5` — All `ready-for-dev` + `backlog` stories in Epic 5
- `/enhanced-automated-sprint 5 5-1 5-2` — Only stories 5-1 and 5-2
- `/enhanced-automated-sprint 5 --parallel 2` — Epic 5, run up to 2 stories in parallel
- `/enhanced-automated-sprint 5 5-1 --skip-elicitation` — Skip Step 2 for speed

**Defaults:** `--parallel 1` (sequential), elicitation ON, auto-fix OFF

**Optimization:** Worktree isolation is decided at spawn time based on **actual concurrency**, not just the `--parallel` flag:

- If `--parallel 1`: Steps 5/9 run directly on the working branch WITHOUT worktree isolation (no merge steps 6/10 needed).
- If `--parallel >= 2` but only ONE story is actually at Step 5/9 in this wave: skip worktree, run directly. No point paying worktree + merge overhead for a single concurrent implementation.
- If `--parallel >= 2` AND multiple stories reach Step 5/9 in the same wave: use `isolation: "worktree"` for each, then sequential merges via Steps 6/10.

## Phase 0: Discovery & Planning

<rules CRITICAL="TRUE">
Before ANY pipeline work begins, the coordinator MUST:

1. **Load BMAD config** — read `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve `{output_folder}`, `{user_name}`, `{communication_language}`
2. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`** — extract EPIC_ID, optional STORY_IDS, and flags
3. **Read sprint-status.yaml** at `{output_folder}/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
4. **Identify target stories:**
   - If STORY_IDS provided: use exactly those
   - If only EPIC_ID: collect all stories with status `ready-for-dev` or `backlog` (skip `done`, `in-progress`)
5. **Read the epic file** at `{output_folder}/planning-artifacts/epic-${EPIC_ID}.md` to understand story dependencies and ordering
6. **Determine story execution order:**
   - Stories with no inter-story dependencies can run in parallel (up to `--parallel N`)
   - Stories that depend on other stories in the batch must run after their dependency completes
   - Default: sequential in story number order
7. **Size check:** If any story is Size M or larger, warn the user and suggest breaking it into Size S stories before proceeding
8. **Create the task list** using TaskCreate (see Task Structure below)
9. **Present the plan** to the user and wait for approval before proceeding
   </rules>

## Task Structure

For each story, create tasks using TaskCreate, then set dependencies via TaskUpdate (`addBlockedBy`). The coordinator creates ALL tasks upfront, then wires up `blockedBy` relationships, then works through them respecting dependencies.

### Task Naming Convention

Tasks use the format: `[STORY_ID] Step N: <step-name>`

This ensures unique task names across stories and clear identification.

### Per-Story Tasks (created for EACH story)

For story `${SID}`:

| Task Subject                             | ActiveForm                                     | Blocked By                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `[${SID}] Step 1: Create story`          | `Creating story ${SID}`                        | — \*                                    |
| `[${SID}] Step 2: Advanced elicitation`  | `Running elicitation on ${SID}`                | `[${SID}] Step 1: Create story`         |
| `[${SID}] Step 3: Validate story`        | `Validating story ${SID}`                      | `[${SID}] Step 2: Advanced elicitation` |
| `[${SID}] Step 4: TDD test generation`   | `Generating TDD tests for ${SID}`              | `[${SID}] Step 3: Validate story`       |
| `[${SID}] Step 5: Implementation`        | `Implementing story ${SID}`                    | `[${SID}] Step 4: TDD test generation`  |
| `[${SID}] Step 6: Merge implementation`  | `Merging ${SID} implementation to main branch` | `[${SID}] Step 5: Implementation`       |
| `[${SID}] Step 7: Code review`           | `Reviewing code for ${SID}`                    | `[${SID}] Step 6: Merge implementation` |
| `[${SID}] Step 8: Adversarial review`    | `Adversarial review of ${SID}`                 | `[${SID}] Step 7: Code review`          |
| `[${SID}] Step 9: Fix action items`      | `Fixing review items for ${SID}`               | `[${SID}] Step 8: Adversarial review`   |
| `[${SID}] Step 10: Merge fixes`          | `Merging ${SID} review fixes to main branch`   | `[${SID}] Step 9: Fix action items`     |
| `[${SID}] Step 11: AC trace`             | `Tracing ACs for ${SID}`                       | `[${SID}] Step 10: Merge fixes`         |
| `[${SID}] Step 12: Update sprint status` | `Updating sprint status for ${SID}`            | `[${SID}] Step 11: AC trace`            |

**\*** Coordinator sets Step 1 `blockedBy` dynamically: no blocker in parallel mode, previous story's Step 12 in sequential mode (`--parallel 1`), or inter-story dependency's Step 12 if epic defines one.

If `--skip-elicitation`: ALWAYS create Step 2 in the task graph (keeps the dependency chain intact), but mark it as `completed` immediately at creation time. This avoids conditional task graph construction — Step 3 still blocks on Step 2, which is already done.

### Cross-Story Dependencies

- **Sequential mode** (`--parallel 1`): Story B's Step 1 is blocked by Story A's Step 12
- **Parallel mode** (`--parallel N`): No cross-story `blockedBy` for independent stories — the **coordinator** enforces parallelism limits and merge gates (Steps 6, 10) at spawn time, NOT via task dependencies. This keeps the task graph simple and avoids false blocking.
  - Exception: Stories WITH inter-story dependencies (noted in epic file) DO get `blockedBy` on their dependency's Step 12.
- **Worktree isolation** (Steps 5, 9): These steps run in git worktrees (`isolation: "worktree"`), so they CAN run in parallel across stories. Each agent gets its own repo copy — no file conflicts during implementation.
- **Merge gates** (Steps 6, 10): After worktree work completes, the **BMAD Dev Agent (Amelia — Senior Software Engineer)** integrates the worktree branch back to the working branch. Merges run SEQUENTIALLY (one at a time) to avoid merge race conditions. Amelia resolves conflicts with senior-level judgment, verifies all tests pass post-merge, and speaks in file paths and AC IDs — no fluff.

### Epic-Level Tasks

| Task Subject                                      | ActiveForm                                     | Blocked By                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `[Epic ${EPIC_ID}] Cross-story integration check` | `Running cross-story integration verification` | All stories' Step 12                              |
| `[Epic ${EPIC_ID}] Sprint summary`                | `Generating sprint summary`                    | `[Epic ${EPIC_ID}] Cross-story integration check` |

**Cross-story integration check** runs AFTER all stories are individually complete. It verifies that stories don't break each other when combined:

1. Run: `${test_command}` — full test suite (catches cross-story conflicts like duplicate routes, naming collisions)
2. Run: `${typecheck_command}` — type check (catches cross-story type conflicts)
3. Run: `${build_command}` — full build (catches cross-story import/bundling issues)
4. If any check fails: report failing tests/errors, identify which stories' files are involved, ask user whether to fix or rollback
5. If all pass: mark as completed, proceed to sprint summary

## Execution Engine: Parallel Story Processing

<parallel-execution CRITICAL="TRUE">
The coordinator runs a **wave-based execution loop**. Each iteration:

1. **Call TaskList** — get all tasks and their statuses
2. **Identify ALL unblocked tasks** — tasks where every `blockedBy` dependency is `completed`
3. **Group unblocked tasks by concurrency rules:**
   - Steps 1, 2, 3 (story creation/elicitation/validation): **PARALLEL** — no shared files
   - Step 4 (TDD): **PARALLEL** — safe because test files are story-scoped. Each agent writes only to its own story's test files. If stories share a test file, fall back to SEQUENTIAL for Step 4.
   - Step 5 (implementation): **PARALLEL in worktrees** — `isolation: "worktree"` gives each agent its own repo copy
   - Steps 6, 10 (merges): **SEQUENTIAL** — merge one worktree branch at a time to avoid race conditions
   - Steps 7, 8 (reviews): **PARALLEL** — read-only analysis
   - Step 9 (fixes): **PARALLEL in worktrees** — same worktree isolation as Step 5
   - Step 11: **PARALLEL** — read-only analysis
   - Step 12: **COORDINATOR-SEQUENTIAL** — delegates to `/bmad-bmm-sprint-status` one story at a time. Two concurrent writes to the same YAML file = data loss.
4. **Spawn agents for ALL parallelizable unblocked tasks in a SINGLE message** — this is how Claude Code runs agents concurrently. Multiple Task tool calls in one response = true parallelism.
5. **Wait for all spawned agents to complete**
6. **Mark completed tasks, report results, loop back to step 1**

### Parallelism Example

Given stories A-1 and A-2 with `--parallel 2` and no inter-story dependencies:

```
Wave 1:  [A-1] Step 1 + [A-2] Step 1       ← parallel (story creation)
Wave 2:  [A-1] Step 2 + [A-2] Step 2       ← parallel (elicitation)
Wave 3:  [A-1] Step 3 + [A-2] Step 3       ← parallel (validation)
Wave 4:  [A-1] Step 4 + [A-2] Step 4       ← parallel (TDD tests)
Wave 5:  [A-1] Step 5 + [A-2] Step 5       ← parallel IN WORKTREES (both implement concurrently!)
Wave 6:  [A-1] Step 6                       ← SEQUENTIAL merge (Amelia merges A-1 first)
Wave 7:  [A-2] Step 6                       ← SEQUENTIAL merge (Amelia merges A-2, resolves conflicts if any)
Wave 8:  [A-1] Step 7 + [A-2] Step 7       ← parallel (code review)
Wave 9:  [A-1] Step 8 + [A-2] Step 8       ← parallel (adversarial review)
Wave 10: [A-1] Step 9 + [A-2] Step 9       ← parallel IN WORKTREES (fixes)
Wave 11: [A-1] Step 10                      ← SEQUENTIAL merge
Wave 12: [A-2] Step 10                      ← SEQUENTIAL merge
Wave 13: [A-1] Step 11 + [A-2] Step 11     ← parallel (AC trace)
Wave 14: [A-1] Step 12, then [A-2] Step 12 ← COORDINATOR-SEQUENTIAL (same YAML file)
```

**Speedup:** 14 waves vs 20+ sequential steps. Implementation (the longest step) now runs concurrently across stories.

### How to Spawn Parallel Agents

**CRITICAL:** To run agents in parallel, you MUST include multiple Task tool calls in a SINGLE response message. Example:

```
Response contains:
  Task tool call 1: "[A-1] Step 1: Create story"
  Task tool call 2: "[A-2] Step 1: Create story"
```

Both agents launch concurrently. You receive both results before your next turn.

**DO NOT** spawn one agent, wait for it, then spawn the next — that is sequential, not parallel.

### Worktree Isolation (Steps 5, 9)

Steps 5 and 9 run with `isolation: "worktree"` on the Task tool. This gives each agent its own git worktree — a full copy of the repo on its own branch. Multiple stories implement concurrently without file conflicts.

The worktree agent's branch and path are returned in the Task result. The coordinator passes this info to the merge step.

### Sequential Merge Gates (Steps 6, 10)

These are the ONLY serialization points in the pipeline. Merges run one at a time to prevent race conditions:

| Step                         | What                                                  | Who                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Step 6: Merge implementation | Merge worktree branch from Step 5 into working branch | **BMAD Dev Agent (Amelia)** — Opus |
| Step 10: Merge fixes         | Merge worktree branch from Step 9 into working branch | **BMAD Dev Agent (Amelia)** — Opus |

All other steps parallelize freely because they either:

- Write to story-specific files (Steps 1, 2, 4)
- Run in isolated worktrees (Steps 5, 9)
- Are read-only analysis (Steps 3, 7, 8, 11)

Step 12 delegates to `/bmad-bmm-sprint-status` and runs sequentially (shared `sprint-status.yaml` file).
</parallel-execution>

## Execution Rules

<rules CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. **Act as COORDINATOR** — delegate all work via Task tool agents, do NOT execute pipeline steps yourself
2. **One agent per step** — each step spawns a focused Task agent with ONLY the context it needs (story file path, test file paths, etc.). Do NOT pass full conversation history.
3. **PARALLEL by default** — when multiple tasks are unblocked AND parallelizable (see Sequential Gate Rules above), spawn them ALL in a single message. This is the core performance advantage of the enhanced pipeline.
4. **TaskUpdate before and after** — mark task `in_progress` BEFORE spawning the agent, mark `completed` AFTER agent succeeds
5. **TaskList after each wave** — check what's unblocked next
6. **Failure stops the STORY, not the sprint** — if a step fails for one story, mark it failed, report to user, but continue with other stories if they're independent
7. **Context budget per agent:** Each agent should read at most 5-8 files. If a step needs more context, break it into sub-agents.
8. **Steps 9 + 10 are conditional** — only create a fix agent if Steps 7 or 8 produced action items. If no items, mark BOTH 9 AND 10 as completed immediately and proceed to Step 11.
9. **Step 12 uses BMAD** — delegate to `/bmad-bmm-sprint-status` to update sprint-status.yaml, one story at a time (sequential)
10. **Progress checkpoints** — after every wave, output a progress summary to the user
11. **If context feels heavy** — after completing a full story's pipeline, output a handoff summary and suggest the user refresh the session if more stories remain
</rules>

## Agent Spawn Templates

### Focused Agent Pattern

Each agent gets a **minimal, focused prompt** — only what it needs, no pipeline history.

**NOTE:** Templates below are pseudo-code showing the Task tool parameters. The coordinator translates these to actual Task tool calls with JSON parameters. All named parameters (`description`, `subagent_type`, `model`, `isolation`, `prompt`) are real Task tool parameters. The `←` inline comments are documentation only — do not include them in actual tool calls.

**SKILL INVOCATION WARNING:** Steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 11 invoke `/bmad-bmm-*` skills inside Task agents. If the Skill tool is not available inside Task agents, the coordinator MUST use a fallback: instead of `Execute: /bmad-bmm-create-story ${SID}`, load the skill's workflow YAML directly and pass its instructions inline in the prompt. The coordinator should test skill availability in Phase 0 by spawning a lightweight probe agent that attempts `/bmad-help` — if it fails, switch all templates to inline-workflow mode.

#### Step 1: Create Story

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Create story"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: opus
  prompt: |
    Run the BMAD create-story workflow for story ${SID}.
    Execute: /bmad-bmm-create-story ${SID}

    Epic file: {output_folder}/planning-artifacts/epic-${EPIC_ID}.md
    Sprint status: {output_folder}/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml

    Report back:
    - Story file path created
    - AC count and 1-line summary each
    - Task breakdown count
    - Any blockers or questions
```

#### Step 2: Advanced Elicitation (Automated)

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Elicitation"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: opus
  prompt: |
    You are enhancing story ${SID} via advanced elicitation. This is FULLY AUTOMATED.

    1. Read the story file at: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}
    2. Read methods CSV at: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/methods.csv
    3. Auto-select the 3 methods most relevant to this story's context
    4. Apply each method in sequence to enhance the story
    5. Save the enhanced story file (overwrite)
    6. Report ONLY THE DELTA — what changed, section by section

    Do NOT return the full story file.
```

#### Step 3: Validate Story

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Validate"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: opus
  prompt: |
    Validate story ${SID} against its epic.
    Execute: /bmad-bmm-create-story validate ${SID}

    Story file: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}
    Epic file: {output_folder}/planning-artifacts/epic-${EPIC_ID}.md

    Report: PASS/FAIL, AC match count, scope drift, missing ACs, action items.
```

#### Step 4: TDD Test Generation

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] TDD tests"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: sonnet
  prompt: |
    Generate TDD tests for story ${SID}.
    Execute: /bmad-bmm-qa-automate TDD ${SID} yolo

    Story file: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}

    Report: test file paths, test count, AC coverage, red phase confirmation.
```

#### Step 5: Implementation (Worktree Isolated)

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Implement"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: sonnet
  isolation: "worktree"          ← agent gets its own repo copy (only when parallel)
  prompt: |
    Implement story ${SID} to pass all TDD tests.
    Execute: /bmad-bmm-dev-story ${SID} yolo

    Story file: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}
    Test files: ${TEST_FILE_PATHS}

    Report: files changed/created, test results, typecheck status, build status, key decisions.
    IMPORTANT: Your changes are in a worktree branch. Do NOT merge — the coordinator handles merging.
```

**Coordinator note:** The Task result will include the worktree branch name and path. Save these for Step 6.

#### Step 6: Merge Implementation (BMAD Dev Agent — SEQUENTIAL)

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Dev merge"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: opus
  prompt: |
    You are Amelia, the BMAD Developer Agent — a Senior Software Engineer.
    Your identity: Execute with strict adherence to story details and team standards.
    Your communication style: Ultra-succinct. Speak in file paths and AC IDs — every statement citable. No fluff, all precision.
    Your principle: All existing and new tests must pass 100%.

    ## Your Role
    You are the quality gate between isolated implementation and the shared codebase.
    You merge with the judgment of a senior engineer — not blindly.

    ## Context
    - Worktree branch: ${WORKTREE_BRANCH} (from Step 5 result)
    - Target branch: ${WORKING_BRANCH} (the sprint's working branch)
    - Story: ${SID}
    - Story file: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}

    ## Merge Protocol

    1. **Pre-merge setup:**
       - Run: git checkout ${WORKING_BRANCH}
       - Verify: git branch --show-current (MUST be on target branch before merge)

    2. **Pre-merge review:**
       - Run: git log ${WORKING_BRANCH}..${WORKTREE_BRANCH} --oneline
       - Understand what the implementation branch changed
       - Run: git diff ${WORKING_BRANCH}...${WORKTREE_BRANCH} --stat
       - Identify files touched and potential conflict areas

    3. **Merge:**
       - Run: git merge ${WORKTREE_BRANCH} --no-ff -m "feat: merge story ${SID} implementation"
       - If clean merge: proceed to verification
       - If conflicts: resolve them with senior judgment (see sub-step 4 below — Conflict Resolution)

    4. **Conflict Resolution (if needed):**
       - Read BOTH versions of conflicting files fully
       - Read the story file to understand the INTENT of the changes
       - Resolve by preserving both stories' functionality — never silently drop one side
       - If a conflict is ambiguous (unclear which side is correct), STOP and report to coordinator
       - After resolving: git add <resolved files> && git commit -m "merge: resolve ${SID} conflicts"

    5. **Post-merge verification:**
       - Pre-merge test count: run `${test_list_command}` BEFORE the merge (capture in step 1)
       - Run: ${test_command} (ALL tests must pass — not just this story's tests)
       - Post-merge test count: run `${test_list_command}` AFTER merge
       - **Test count regression check:** post-merge count MUST be >= pre-merge count. If tests were deleted by the merge, STOP and report — this is a merge conflict resolution error.
       - Run: ${typecheck_command} (must be clean)
       - Run: ${build_command} (must succeed)
       - If any check fails: diagnose, fix, commit the fix, re-verify

    6. **Cleanup:**
       - Check if worktree still exists: git worktree list
       - If Task tool auto-cleaned the worktree: skip removal
       - If worktree still exists: git worktree remove ${WORKTREE_PATH} && git branch -d ${WORKTREE_BRANCH}

    ## Report Back
    - Merge result: clean / conflicts resolved / BLOCKED (ambiguous conflict)
    - Conflicts: [list files if any, with resolution summary]
    - Post-merge tests: [count] passing (pre-merge: [count], delta: +[N])
    - Test count regression: none / REGRESSION DETECTED ([details])
    - Typecheck: clean / [errors]
    - Build: success / failure
    - Files merged: [count]
```

#### Step 7: Code Review

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Code review"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: opus
  prompt: |
    Code review story ${SID} implementation.
    Execute: /bmad-bmm-code-review ${SID} yolo

    Story file: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}
    Implementation files: ${IMPL_FILE_PATHS}
    Test files: ${TEST_FILE_PATHS}

    Report: verdict, issues table (# | severity | issue | fix), AC verification count, action item count.
```

#### Step 8: Adversarial Review

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Adversarial review"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: opus
  prompt: |
    Cynical adversarial review of the full delivery for story ${SID}.
    Execute: /bmad-review-adversarial-general

    Review these files as a package:
    - Story: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}
    - Implementation: ${IMPL_FILE_PATHS}
    - Tests: ${TEST_FILE_PATHS}

    Report: findings table (# | severity | category | finding | recommendation), critical count, total count.
```

#### Step 9: Fix Action Items (Conditional, Worktree Isolated)

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] Fix review items"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: sonnet
  isolation: "worktree"          ← fixes run in isolated worktree (only when parallel)
  prompt: |
    Fix the following action items from code review and adversarial review for story ${SID}.

    Items to fix:
    ${CONSOLIDATED_ACTION_ITEMS}

    Implementation files: ${IMPL_FILE_PATHS}
    Test files: ${TEST_FILE_PATHS}

    After fixing:
    1. Run: ${test_command} (all tests must pass)
    2. Run: ${typecheck_command} (must be clean)
    3. Run: ${build_command} (must succeed)

    Report: each fix with before/after, test count, typecheck status, build status.
    IMPORTANT: Your changes are in a worktree branch. Do NOT merge — the coordinator handles merging.
```

**Coordinator note:** Save worktree branch/path from result for Step 10. If Step 9 was skipped (no action items), also skip Step 10.

#### Step 10: Merge Fixes (BMAD Dev Agent — SEQUENTIAL)

Same agent template as Step 6 (Amelia, Senior Software Engineer persona), but with:

- Description: `"[${SID}] Dev merge fixes"`
- Commit message: `"fix: merge story ${SID} review fixes"`
- Worktree branch/path from Step 9 result

#### Step 11: AC Trace

```
Task tool:
  description: "[${SID}] AC trace"
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  model: sonnet
  prompt: |
    Trace all acceptance criteria to test coverage for story ${SID}.
    Execute: /bmad-bmm-qa-automate TRACE ${SID} yolo

    Story file: ${STORY_FILE_PATH}
    Test files: ${TEST_FILE_PATHS}
    Implementation files: ${IMPL_FILE_PATHS}

    Report: AC trace matrix, total tests passing, gaps, implementation file list.
```

## Step Output Requirements

### Step 6 / 10: BMAD Dev Agent (Amelia) Merge — Output

```
**Step 6 Complete: Amelia Merge — ${SID}**
- Merge result: clean / conflicts resolved / BLOCKED
- Worktree branch: ${WORKTREE_BRANCH} → ${WORKING_BRANCH}
- Conflicts: [list files + resolution summary, or "None"]
- Post-merge tests: [count] passing (pre-merge: [count], delta: +[N])
- Test count regression: none / REGRESSION DETECTED
- Typecheck: clean / [errors]
- Build: success / failure
- Files merged: [count]
```

The coordinator MUST present each step's output as it completes. Do NOT batch outputs.

## Progress Reporting

### After Each Task Completion

```
✅ [${SID}] Step N: <step-name> — <1-line result>
   Next: [${SID}] Step N+1: <next-step-name>
   Progress: X/Y tasks complete across Z stories
```

### After Each Story Completion

```
## Story ${SID} Complete ✅

| Step | Status | Key Output |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1    | ✅     | ...        |
| ...  | ...    | ...        |

Tests: [count] passing | Typecheck: clean | Build: ✅
Stories remaining: [count]
```

### Progress Checkpoint (After Every Wave)

```
## Sprint Progress — [timestamp]

| Story | Current Step | Status | Tests | Issues |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| A-1   | Step 5      | 🔧     | 12    | 0      |
| A-2   | Step 1      | ⏸️     | —     | —      |

Tasks: X completed / Y total | ETA: ~Z steps remaining
```

## Decision Points & User Interaction

<decision-rules>
1. **Step 1 (create-story):** ALWAYS pause for user review of ACs and dev notes before proceeding
2. **Step 3 (validate):** If FAIL → stop that story, ask user how to proceed
3. **Steps 7/8 (reviews):** If action items found:
   - `--auto-fix`: auto-proceed to Step 9 with all items
   - Default: present items, ask user which to fix (all / medium+ / skip)
4. **Step failure:** Report error, mark story as blocked, ask user: retry / skip story / stop sprint
5. **Size M+ story detected in Phase 0:** Warn and suggest decomposition before starting
6. **Context getting heavy:** After completing a story, suggest session refresh if 2+ stories remain
</decision-rules>

## Error Recovery

<error-recovery>
- **Agent timeout/crash:** Mark task as pending (not completed), report to user, offer retry
- **Test failures in Step 5:** Agent should attempt to fix. If still failing after implementation, report failing tests and stop that story's pipeline.
- **Build failure:** Same as test failure — agent attempts fix, escalates if stuck
- **Circular story dependency:** Detected in Phase 0, reported immediately, pipeline does not start
- **All stories failed:** Output summary of failures, suggest `/bmad-bmm-correct-course`
- **Post-merge rollback (Steps 7/8 find critical issue after Step 6 merge):**
  1. Amelia identifies the merge commit hash from Step 6 output
  2. Run: `git revert <merge-commit-hash> --no-edit` (creates a revert commit, preserving history)
  3. Verify: `${test_command} && ${typecheck_command} && ${build_command}` (working branch is clean again)
  4. Report to user: merge reverted, story blocked, action items listed
  5. Step 9 fixes then run in worktree starting from the pre-merge state
  6. After fixes: re-merge via a new Step 6 invocation (Amelia merges the fixed branch)
  7. NEVER use `git reset --hard` — revert preserves history and is safe for shared branches
</error-recovery>

| Step 5: Implementation | sonnet      | **worktree** | Longest step, worktree enables parallel execution across stories                                           |
| Step 6: Merge impl     | **opus**    | —            | **BMAD Dev Agent (Amelia)** — senior engineer merge judgment, conflict resolution, post-merge verification |
| Step 7: Code review    | opus        | —            | Architectural and security judgment                                                                        |
